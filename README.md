# Scatter-plot-with-color-grading-in-Excel
VBA code to colour xy-scatter charts in Excel according to a colour map as well as creating a dynamic colour bar.

All the code is in [ChartColouring.bas](https://github.com/DanGolding/Scatter-plot-with-color-grading-in-Excel/blob/master/ChartColouring.bas). An example spreadsheet is also provided for demonstration.

Below are before and after examples of regular scatter charts produced by Excel and how this code can alter them.


Scatter plot without colouring              |  Scatter plot using a sequential colour map
:------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:
![](/Images/Sequential_(grey).png?raw=true)  |  ![](/Images/Sequential_(colour).png?raw=true)


Scatter plot without colouring              |  Scatter plot using a diveregent colour map
:------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:
![](/Images/Divergent_(grey).png?raw=true)  |  ![](/Images/Divergent_(colour).png?raw=true)
